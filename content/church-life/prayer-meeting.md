In our church, we believe that God is like a caring parent and a powerful protector we can turn to for help. There are things in our lives, in our church, and in the world that we really want God to change.

That's why we come together to ask God for help in different areas. Whether it's getting better when we're sick, having what we need, or finding God, we ask our Heavenly Father to step in.
