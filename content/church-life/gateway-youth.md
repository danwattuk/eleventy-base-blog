Start children off on the way they should go,
and even when they are old they will not turn from it.

Proverbs 22 v 6

We really care about helping your teenagwers get to know Jesus better and grow closer to him. We use our own special way of teaching from the Bible, with fun games, interesting Bible stories, and cool team activities. We want your child to be able to use what they learn on Sunday nights in their everyday life. Our goal is to raise up the next generation of awesome kids who can make a positive difference in the world!

Once a month we visit [Audacious church in Machester](https://audaciouschurch.com/) for an awesome time of worship and teaching.
