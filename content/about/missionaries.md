#Caminul Felix
Caminul Felix believes that the Family Concept is the key to unlocking a child that has been neglected and abandoned. A child suffering from trauma and abandonment needs a safe haven where he or she can feel secure and have time to heal and discover life. We assist Caminul Felix Family Villages in providing that havenâ€”a home, loving adoptive parents and an extended family, brothers and sisters.

#Love Russia
At a crisis centre, where most of the mums were orphanage leavers, the blessings of shelter, food, counselling and nurturing of faith gives homeless mums and their children the chance to rebuild their lives. Love Russia supports the crisis centre with funding, practical help and prayer and in 2016 a brand new safe play area was built by Love Russia for the children who come to stay here with their mums.
