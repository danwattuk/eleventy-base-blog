# Assemblies of God

The Assemblies of God is a Pentecostal denomination that has been serving the people of Great Britain since 1924.

As a movement of churches we believe that Jesus is still working in His church through the power of His Spirit to change people’s lives for the better. To this end we seek to build churches that demonstrate God’s love to our communities in a practical and relevant way.
