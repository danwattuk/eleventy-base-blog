# Your pastoral team

# Senior Leader - Paul Sherwin

Hi, I am married to Sally and we have three children.
Bethany, who is married to Josh and they live near Leeds.
Joe who is in his early 20s and after studying Materials Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University, is now on a Leadership Academy Internship at Hope City Church in Sheffield.
Sam is our third child and he is studying Landscape Architecture at the University of Gloucestershire.
I became the Senior Leader at Gateway Church in December 2016.
I am now a Full Status Assemblies of God Minister.
My Passion is for mission and to see the church fully mobilised into all of its potential so it can impact our community with the Good News of Jesus.

# Elder - Cristi Tudosie

I became a Christian whilst at University and, during the summer break, travelled to Italy with Operation Mobilisation. I joined their ships Logos and Doulos, and spent five years visiting many countries and encouraging local churches. I’ve been married to Rachel for 30 years and we have two adult children and three grandchildren (so we are childminding regularly!) For twenty years I worked in a Day centre for adults with learning disabilities – many of whom have multiple and profound disabilities. I am now semi-retired, which is ideal for my eldership responsibilities. I’m involved in Bible teaching and corporate prayer on a regular basis , and my wife and I lead Worship together.
