# What we believe

Our beliefs are all taken from the Bible and all are foundational to Christian living.

We encourage you to look up these scriptures in order to see why we believe what we believe.

1. We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God.
2. We believe in one God, who has revealed Himself in three persons – Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
3. We believe in the virgin birth, sinless life, miraculous ministry, substitutional death of Jesus Christ, His resurrection, His ascension into heaven and His second coming to bring everyone to account for their lives.
4. We believe in the fall of man and his separation from God through sin.
5. We believe in salvation through faith in Christ who died for our sins and was raised for our peace with God and victory in the life He gives. Through His blood we have redemption.
6. We believe in water baptism.
7. We believe that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is an essential part of the Christian experience, designed to empower for service and witness.
8. We believe that our primary vision is to become like Jesus in all that we think, say and do.
9. We believe that deliverance from the devil’s authority, selfish habits and oppression is provided through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
10. We believe in both heaven and hell and that faith in the good news of Christ makes all of the difference.
