<h1>Sunday</h1>
<div class = "sunday-image"> </div>


<p>We meet in person each Sunday, with live worship, preaching, prayer, and an opportunity to meet with people from across the church community.
Each week we come expectant to meet with God and to share together as we do.
Tea and coffee are served afterwards in our café area.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
We provide staffed groups for all children aged 2-4 and of Primary school age.
Our children’s team love welcoming new children to the groups, and are available each week to answer any questions you may have about how the groups work.</p>
